# **Waze Churn Analysis Project Proposal**

## Overview

### Background and Context

Waze is a community-driven navigation platform that enables drivers around the world to travel more efficiently and safely. By combining real-time user input with map data and partner integrations, Waze continuously improves route quality, traffic awareness, and overall driving experience.   
**User retention is a critical driver of Waze’s long-term growth and product effectiveness**. Sustained engagement ensures the availability of high-quality, real-time traffic data while strengthening the value of Waze’s ecosystem for users, partners, and public-sector collaborators. Conversely, **user churn** (defined as **users uninstalling the app** or **discontinuing usage**) can negatively impact growth, data coverage, and the effectiveness of community-powered features. As p**art of Waze’s broader growth and retention strategy**, there is a need to better understand the behavioural patterns that precede user churn. Leveraging user-level behavioural data presents an opportunity to identify at-risk users early and enable proactive retention efforts.

### Problem Statement

Waze lacks a consolidated analytical framework for identifying users who are likely to churn in the near term. Without early indicators, retention initiatives risk being reactive or insufficiently targeted. Key unanswered questions include:

* Which users are most likely to churn?  
* What behavioural patterns are associated with churn?  
* When does churn risk increase during a user’s lifecycle?

### Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:

* Analyse user behaviour to identify patterns and signals associated with monthly churn  
* Segment users based on churn risk  
* Develop a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of churn at the user level  
* Identify key factors that contribute most strongly to churn risk

### Expected Impact

This project is expected to deliver:

* Clear visibility into user behaviours associated with churn  
* Early identification of users at elevated churn risk  
* Actionable insights to inform targeted retention strategies  
* A reusable analytical framework for future retention initiatives
